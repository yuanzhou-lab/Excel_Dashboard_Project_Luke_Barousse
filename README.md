# Excel_Dashboard_Project_Luke_Barousse

This is the a small practise project following the 'Excel for Data Analyst' course offered by Luke Barousse.

The input of the project is a dataset capturing all Data jobs published in year 2023, mainly from the US job market source. The dataset involves 32 thousand job entries. Unique key on job posting date, job titles pre-cleaned to 10 distinct values including:  
-Data Analyst  
-Data Scientist  
-Data Engineer  
-Business Analyst  
-Senior Data Analyst  
 etc.  
Other columns include job countries, year and hourly salaries, job publishing platforms and so on.

The output is a dashboard showing aggregated information with three variables set up as a drop down list.

Key take aways from this project:  
-Usage of the dynamic array in modern excel  
-Use of simple functions such as 'UNIQUE' 'SORT' on arrays  
-Use of aggregate functions such as 'FILTER' 'SUMPRODUCT' on arrays  
-Flexible usage of Boolean values in excel data analysis  
-Use of different Excel Charts  
-Proper sheet protection treatment when collaborating with other team members  

Please see the attached file as result. The workbook and dashboard sheet is protected but needs NO password to open up the details.
